TODO: clean up and upload files

These are some of my old C and Java course excercises and assignments from around 2004-2005.
I was in the beginning of my studies in University of Oulu, studying Information Prcessing Science,
or Computer Science as it is probably known today.

As I have now, 2022, returned back to these studies, I wanted to take a look back in time.
I plan to edit these files further, and at least fix some of the bugs that are still left.

The variables and commenting is in Finnish. I'll try and add at least a short summary in English
when fixing these.
